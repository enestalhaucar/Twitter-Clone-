I did a cloning by looking at the website of the Twitter app. I made the menu on the left first. While making the left side menu, I copied the svg files of the icons using Google Developer Tools. I made them come sequentially one after the other by writing a function. I also added the style with Tailwind.css. Then I made the profile part in the lower left part. I used my own photo in this part. Then I cloned the search bar and Trends in the right menu. In addition, there is a Tweet creation place in the middle.
